XTC - A clone of the DOS file manager XTree Gold
Version 0.1.9, August 15 1999

What is XTC?
------------
XTC is a UNIX-based clone of the popular XTree Gold file manager for DOS. It is
currently in development and contains only file and directory manipulation
features. Eventually, many if not all of the features of the original will be
included, including:

- File viewer
- Text editor
- Hex editor
- Archive manipulation
- Command-line window
- On-line help.

It also supports UNIX-specific features such as long filenames, symbolic links
and file permissions. There are a few DOS-specific features of the original such
as drive logging and undeletion that may not be included.

The program is currently being developed under Linux, but it will eventually
support other UNIX variants.

XTC is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). See the file COPYING
for details.


Obtaining the latest version of XTC

COPYING.

Compiling XTC
-------------

To compile XTC, run these commands:

./configure
make

This will produce an executable called xtc.

XTC has been found to work on the following systems:

Redhat Linux 6.0, ncurses-4.2
Redhat Linux 5.2, ncurses-4.2
FreeBSD 3.1-RELEASE, ncurses-1.8.6

I do not know what other platforms it will work with, but I would like to hear
from others about successes/problems they have had compiling, and if possible,
solutions to these problems.

Usage
-----
If you are familiar with XTree Gold or it's WIN32 clone ZTreeWin
(http://www.ztree.com) then you'll find XTC works in much the same way. I have
listed all the keys that are available in the file "docs.html" but I intend to
write some more detailed documentation in the future.

There are a few differences from the original, however, due to the way that
terminals work under UNIX:

- Instead of pressing ESC, you must use F10. This is because when you press ESC,
  it is treated as the start of an escape sequence. There is a half-second pause
  before the terminal realises that it is only the ESC key that has been
  pressed, but this gets frustrating. Maybe it could be modified to accept both
  keys.
- CTRL-M has the same keycode as the ENTER key. CTRL-I has the same keycode as
  the TAB key. And CTRL-H has the same keycode as the BACKSPACE key. Don't ask
  me why. The only one of these that is in use at the moment (or rather, that I
  have wanted to use so far) is CTRL-M for move tagged files. But since ENTER
  switches between file and directory mode, I have decided to make it CTRL-K, at
  least until I find a better solution to this problem.
- XTree would display the CTRL and ALT commands whenever you held down one of
  these keys, and copyright info when you held down both. But in Linux, I can't
  find a way to detect when one of these is held down, apart from on the console
  where I can read from the keyboard directly. So XTC doesn't do this.

The above limitations are minor but annoying, and I hope to fix them eventually,
or at least find a better way around them. If you have any ideas on this, let me
know!


Development
-----------
My plans for the project are basically to implement all the basic file
operations (including CTRL and ALT operations), and then release a "stable"
version before moving on to more advanced features such as viewing, editing and
archive support. I would like to keep as close as possible to the original, so
that users familiar with it will feel right at home with this version. Of
course, there will be a few UNIX-specific issues and features that will need to
be taken into account, such as those mentioned above, and things like pipes,
mount points, etc.

If you would like to participate in the development of this program, you'll
probably want to have a copy of XTree Gold or ZTreeWin (which is very close to
the original) handy to see how certain features work, unless you're fairly
familiar with the program. XTree Gold was discontinued serveral years ago and
is no longer available, but you can get a 30-day trial version of ZTreeWin
from www.ztree.com. Both of these should run fine under vmware (www.vmware.com).
XTree Gold is a bit flaky under DOSEmu, and I haven't tried ZTreeWin under
WINE.
