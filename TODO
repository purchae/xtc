Features/Improvements (major)
-----------------------------
- command: New Date
- command: New Date Tagged
- command: Prune Directory
- command: Treespec
- command: Chmod branch
- command: Chown branch
- command: Chgrp branch
- command: Copy Branch
- command: Invert
- command: Invert All
- have some way to view a symbolic link's destination



Features/Improvements (minor)
-----------------------------
- config: colour settings
- config: Read permanent settings from disk
- config: Restore factory default settings
- option for "fixed" tree selection where tree moves instead of selection (like in XTree)
- ALT-Q for quit to directory
- only resize when not in "dialog" type mode
- copy/move/symlink with paths: make option more like xtree (press P to swtich rather than selecting A or R)
- copy: perhaps use block size of dest device for copying instead (if bigger than source),
  to improve performance (e.g. ext2 1k -> fat32 4k would be faster)
- when copying files, open the destination file with the same permissions as the source. This
  could avoid a potential security problem where a user's umask is less restrictive than the
	permissions on the file (at the moment, these permissions are set AFTER the file is copied)
- reloc_file_op() (ui.c): if dest. dir doesn't exist, give option to create
- possibly speed up branch logging (*) by finding a better way to show stats when logging
	(i.e. not re-calculating each time)
- show links with @ on the end, executables with * on the end, etc., and other ones that ls does
- different colours for different filetypes (devices, pipes, symlinks, etc.)
- make "use extended characters for lines" option active after exiting config, rather than on
	next restart

Bugs to be fixed
----------------
- in DATE or ATTRIBUTES view, if just filename is displayed due to short display length,
  hilight only covers filename characters, rather than the whole line (filled to length)
- configuration screen doesn't redraw properly (only draws borders/title)
- get_full_path doesn't work if the user can't access the path
   (should be fixed so it works if they can see the parent)
   (e.g. selecting /root in move F2 returns path, but isn't selected
   if you press F2 again as the get_full_path in file_window_move_ext
   fails)
- after running viewer or editor, and quitting, terminal background is black (even on a non-black background terminal)
- when exiting configuration, if called from file window, lines on edges of window re-appear (as if dir window was there)
- <-| file problem (bottom/left of screen)
- unlog does not free any memory(?) - despite use of free(), top still shows program as
	using same amount of memory after unlog
- sometimes after grafting a dir the |- line next it shows up as being the end
  corner when it is not the last directory and vice-versa
- if resized when in configuration screen, window not redrawn properly when returning to main screen
- Sizes > 4 gig (2 gig?) not reported properly

Misc
----
- make all functions that do not need to be public static and remove from .h files
- change "Retry file" to just "Retry" in status_line_get_response()? (makes it more
	general, more appropriate for directories and other things as well)
- when trying to log a directory and an error occurs, clear the command window before
	displaying the error (and redraw it afterwards) (?) - check what xtree does
- don't allow copy tagged/move tagged (with or without paths) to the same directory?
  ("Source and destination paths are the same")
- improve speed of chown tagged by only parsing chown_string once (partially done -
  dir_window_chown and file_window_chown don't use do_chown, but file_window_chown_tagged
	still does)
- Fix behaviour of left/right keys in directory window (see mail message from Mathias)
- More Documentation!

See commands.txt for a list of what has and hasn't been implemented.
