XTC Key Command Specification

TREE WINDOW

Base Keys

Opening window, using frame setup written by Peter Kelly.
selector bar starts on root directory, traversing the tree as
commanded by user.
Tree is partially logged, as set by user-config.
Initial file-list format is 8X3 in XTG and ZTW. in ytree, it's 
however many columns will fit based on screen size and length of 
longest filename; this is probably a good method to copy.
initial file-list has been single-column in XTC, showing file 
name and file length.

Keys:
[default]
swallow keystrokes without complaint or response.

[Enter]
Selector drops into small file window, or if user-config is set
to BYPASS SMALL FILE WINDOW, switch immediately to LARGE FILE
WINDOW. Either way, selector is placed on first file in displayed
directory according to currently-selected sort order.

[down]
selector bar moves down one directory in current layer. if
selector is already at the last displayed directory but not at
last directory in layer, scroll tree up to keep selector visible.

[up]
selector bar moves up one directory in current layer. if selector
is already at first displayed directory but not at first
directory in layer, scroll tree down to keep selector visible.

[A] Available
SHOW SPACE MENU displaces comand-key menu. Selection shows all
available devices, not just those currently mounted/logged. In
XTG, all drives are ordered as CPM/MSDOS drive letters; we should
show a letter-series menu of all active logical devices (hdb,
fda, nfs shares etc). this will take some design work to plan
a progressive implementation, the endpoint being to show all
locations where the program is currently allowed to store files.

[B] Branch
FLAT FILES MENU opens showing all logged files from currently
selector-bar-selected directory downward.

[C] Compare

[D] Delete
Delete the current directory if it's empty of files or
subdirectories.
User-config determines whether comfirmation is asked ("Delete
<dirname> directory. Delete this directory?").
After the deletion, the selector moves up to prior directory, and
the tree entries scroll up below the deletion point, closing the
hole.

[F] Filespec
COMMANDLINE WINDOW displaces command-key menu to set a filespec
mask. XTG allows three masks; ZTW allows a much longer set, 80h
long or perhaps longer. When the mask is set, files not matching
the spec are not displayed.

[G] Global
FLAT FILES MENU opens showing all currently logged files (based
at a metaroot, usually the same as the Unix tree root but let's
not count on it)

[I] Invert
INVERT SELECTION LIST WINDOW displaces command-key menu to choose
to invert Filespec or Tags.
Inverting filespec displays all files NOT matching the current
mask.
Inverting tags works on currently selected directory and toggles
tags on all filtered files, tagging the untagged and untagging
the tagged. This is a tagging operation: the selector moves
[down] after the operation.

[L] Log
XTG: log a new lettered drive, keeping the files already logged.
(Contrast Ctrl-Log, which abandons curent the log to start a new
filemap.)
ytree: log a new basepoint in the unix tree, using a .


[M] Make
Make a new subdirectory off of the currently-selected
directory.

[O] Oops!
Switch to UNDELETE WINDOW.

[P] Print


[Q] Quit
Exit the program, in the same directory in which it was started.


[R] Rename
Rename currently selected directory.

[S] Showall

[T] Tag
Tag all filtered logged files in currently selected directory.
(Files which are rejected by the current filespec and thus
not displayed are not touched.)

[U] Untag
Untag all filtered logged files in currently selected directory
(Files which are rejected by the current filespec and thus
not displayed are not touched.)

[V] Volume


[X] eXecute
Switch to EXECUTE COMMAND WINDOW, from which to shell out for a
command. In MSDOS, if COMMAND is the typed command, the shell
persists until EXIT. Otherwise, the shell persists for just one
command.
